            <p class="section subtag text-small">Established in 1991 as the School of Interior Design at CEPT, Faculty
                of Design at CEPT University has been a pioneer in formalizing the education of Interior Design in the
                country. Ever since its inception, the Faculty of Design has striven towards excellence in teaching and
                building theoretical grounds for the Interior Design profession.

                The Faculty of Design sees design as a cultural system that deals with all aspects of human evolution,
                the production of culture as well as unfolding of human imagination. Design is thus seen as an
                integrating force bringing together several streams of knowledge. The Faculty therefore adopts an
                interdisciplinary approach towards education in order to meet the cultural needs of the individual as
                well as the society at large.Education at the Faculty of Design addresses Interior Design both as a
                profession and a discipline, focusing on man's engagement with space. It aims at developing thinking,
                inquiring and free spirited individuals with a reflective outlook towards making responsive choices. The
                Faculty offers an Under Graduate program in Interior Design and a Post-Graduate program in Design. The
                Post-Graduate course also has collaboration with International Masters in Interior Architecture and
                Design wherein, the student avails a choice of attaining a dual degree.

                The Bachelor of Interior Design program is structured to allow students to understand human habitation
                by exposure to different contexts through various means like in-class live like experiences, field
                trips, living with craftsmen and case studies encountered at various phases in the student life. These
                engagements enable the students to be both reflective and responsive designers.

            <p class="section subtag text-small">Originally established in 1962 as the School of Architecture, Faculty
                of Architecture, CEPT University, is one of the vital centers of thought and education in the field of
                Architecture in India. It continues to aim for excellence in its teaching and research programs in the
                field of Architecture. The Faculty enjoys an excellent reputation nationally as well as
                internationally.Architecture is situated in physical contexts, both natural and manmade. It is shaped by
                and helps to shape the form of settlements. It has to be responsive to cultural contexts of deep
                historical and ideological significance. It significantly affects the flow of resources and energy.
                Education at this Faculty is therefore based on the premise that an architect is a responsible agent of
                societal change. It aims to give its students a breadth of cultural exposure that shapes a reflective
                and critical outlook based on social and environmental awareness and responsiveness. This must be
                combined with rigorous learning of skills and disciplines necessary in the profession of architecture.
                This twofold orientation and a well-developed pedagogical method have helped the Faculty to become an
                outstanding center of architectural thought, research and learning.

                The Bachelor of Architecture program aims to shape students into thoughtful and responsible individuals
                who are effectively able to tackle the challenges of the profession.

                Architectural Design; 2. Architectural History and Research; 3. Conservation and Regeneration; 4.
